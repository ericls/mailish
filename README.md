# Mailish

A simple WebUI for Mailgun based on elixir phoenix and react.

This is a practice project for me to get familiar with phoenix and react,
bugs and stupidities are expected.

All settings are located at `config/config.exs`, you may also want to include
your database settings in `config/prod.exs` in production environment and create
your `config/prod.secret.exs`.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
